# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ Great News: Database Already Set Up!

The error `policy "Users can view their own deployments" for table "deployments" already exists` means your database is already configured! The table and policies exist.

## 🎯 Next Steps: Test the System

### **Step 1: Check Admin Dashboard**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5174/login`
2. Look for the "Go Live" button
3. It should now be active (not showing "Database Setup Required")

### **Step 2: Upload Resume Data**
1. Upload your resume (JSON or PDF)
2. Wait for "Profile updated across the website" message

### **Step 3: Deploy Live Portfolio**
1. Click the **"Go Live"** button
2. Watch status: `pending` → `building` → `ready`
3. Get your live portfolio URL!

### **Step 4: View Live Portfolio**
1. Click "View Live" or copy the URL
2. Your portfolio should display beautifully
3. Share the URL with anyone!

## 🔍 If Still Having Issues

### **Check Browser Console**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Look for any error messages
3. Check if database connection is working

### **Verify Database Table**
Run this simple query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.deployments LIMIT 1;
```

### **Check RLS Policies**
Run this query to see existing policies:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'deployments';
```

## 🎯 What This Creates

- **`deployments` table** to store portfolio data
- **RLS policies** for security
- **Indexes** for performance
- **Public access** for sharing portfolios

## ✅ Expected Result

After running the SQL:
- ✅ "Go Live" button becomes active
- ✅ Deployments work properly
- ✅ Live portfolio URLs work
- ✅ No more "Portfolio Not Found" errors

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Supabase connection** in browser console
2. **Verify RLS policies** are created
3. **Check user authentication** is working
4. **Look for error messages** in console

The system will work perfectly once the database table is created! 🎉
